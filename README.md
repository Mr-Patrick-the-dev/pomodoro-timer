# Project Pomodoro Timer

For the aid of organized study sessions.

### Note:

This project is a React Application.

## Tools Used

This project utilizes JavaScript, JSX, some HTML, a little CSS, and BootStrap.

The project itself uses a template for Bootstrap, while the JavaScript and JSX were created by me.


## Usage

This project was made to be used by those who are looking for a balance between their study and break times while in a study session.

## Features:

1. Fully customize your break and study session times in increments of 5 minutes (study) and 1 minute (break).
2. The timer is a live countdown of your set session times, with a progress bar included
3. After each session timer is up, an alarm sounds and the next study/break session automatically begins.
  - This continues until the user hits the stop button.
